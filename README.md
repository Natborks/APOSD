# Software Design Explorations

This repository is a collection of small systems designed to explore and apply the ideas from *A Philosophy of Software Design* by John Ousterhout.

The focus of these projects is not on completeness or real-world complexity, but rather on making thoughtful design choices that prioritize:
- Deep modules
- Minimal interfaces
- Clear abstraction boundaries
- Reduced cognitive load

Each project targets one or more key design ideas, and includes a short design rationale explaining the choices made.

## Projects

- **Project 1: Elevator System**  
  A simple simulation of an elevator system where users can request pickups and track elevator status. Explores deep modules, pass-through method tradeoffs, and avoiding temporal decomposition.

More systems and refinements will be added over time as part of this ongoing design practice.
